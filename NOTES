FINDINGS:
- incorrect assertion in sparse set(k, v)
  * assert(value != tombstone) should've been assert(value >= 0)

- archetype moveEntity not handling cases where src == dst

- that stupid json deserialization quirk in @world_internal_test.go. if a snapshot is corrupted at a
  JSON key, go json deser is case-insensitive, so the restored state when reserialized will produce
  different state hashes.
  * Go encoding/json/v2 fixes case-insensitive unmarshal

- archetype.fromProto panics in bitmap.FromBytes if a corrupted bitmap bytes isn't divisible by 8.

- event manager channel capacity is capped, which blocks new events from being enqueued when it is full.

TODO:
- [ ] update `search.go` unit tests
