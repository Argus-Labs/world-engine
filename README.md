World Engine is a sharded layer 2 blockchain SDK designed with the needs of game developers and players in mind. The
World Engineâ€™s main innovation lies in its sharding design inspired by the server architecture of computationally
intensive massively multiplayer online (MMO) games.

Sharding enables game developers to distribute their game load across various shards. Consequently, a World Engine chain
can adjust its throughput in response to demand, growing in tandem with the developer or publisher. At the same time,
World Engineâ€™s sharding architecture also avoids the interoperability/platform fragmentation issues associated with
scaling by spinning up another separate rollup.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to get started with World Engine is to build a game shard using Cardinal. Note, this repo is for the core development of the World Engine only, and should not be used for developing World Engine powered games.

Using the world-cli, you can get started with your own Cardinal game shard. Please see [getting started](https://world.dev/Cardinal/getting-started) for more details.
