## Prerequisites

Before deploying your World Engine project, ensure you have:

- [Created an organization](/forge/organization)
- [Created a project](/forge/project)

## Deployment Overview

World Engine provides a comprehensive deployment system that allows you to deploy your projects to different environments:

- **Preview Environment**: For testing and development
- **Live Environment**: For production deployments

## Deploy to Preview Environment

Deploy your project to the preview environment for testing:

```bash
world deploy
```

This command will:

1. Build your Cardinal shards
2. Package your application
3. Deploy to the preview environment
4. Provide deployment status and URLs

<Note>
  The preview environment is perfect for testing your game before promoting to production.
</Note>

### Force Deploy

If you need to force a deployment (e.g., after configuration changes):

```bash
world deploy --force
```

<Warning>
  Force deployments will override any existing deployment and may cause downtime.
</Warning>

## Check Deployment Status

Monitor the status of your deployed project:

```bash
world status
```

This command provides information about:

- Deployment status (running, failed, building)
- Environment URLs
- Health checks
- Resource usage

## Promote to Live Environment

Once you're satisfied with your preview deployment, promote it to the live environment:

```bash
world promote
```

<Note>
  Promoting to live will make your game available to end users. Ensure thorough testing in preview first.
</Note>

## View Application Logs

Monitor your application in real-time by tailing logs:

```bash
# Default: us-west-2 region, preview environment
world logs

# Specify region and environment
world logs us-east-1 preview
world logs eu-central-1 live
```

### Available Regions

- `us-west-2` (default)
- `us-east-1`
- `eu-central-1`
- `ap-southeast-1`

### Available Environments

- `preview` (default)
- `live`

<Note>
  Logs are streamed in real-time. Use Ctrl+C to stop the log stream.
</Note>

## Reset Deployment

If you need to restart your deployment with a clean state:

```bash
world reset
```

This command will:

1. Stop the current deployment
2. Clear all data and state
3. Redeploy with a fresh environment

<Warning>
  Resetting will clear all game state and data. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Destroy Deployment

Remove your project's infrastructure from the cloud:

```bash
world destroy
```

This command will:

1. Stop all running services
2. Remove all deployed resources
3. Clean up infrastructure

<Warning>
  Destroying your deployment will permanently remove all data and infrastructure. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>
