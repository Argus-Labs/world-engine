**Forge** is World Engine's publishing platform that enables you to deploy your World Engine projects to the cloud with ease. It provides a complete workflow from authentication to production deployment, making it simple to get your games and applications live.

## What is Forge?

Forge is the deployment and publishing arm of World Engine that handles:

- **Cloud Infrastructure** — Managed cloud resources for your World Engine projects
- **Deployment Pipeline** — Automated build and deployment processes
- **Environment Management** — Preview and production environments
- **Team Collaboration** — Organization and project management
- **Monitoring & Logs** — Real-time application monitoring and debugging

## Getting Started with Forge

The Forge workflow consists of five main steps:

### 1. Authentication

Start by authenticating with World Engine using your Argus ID:

```bash
world login
```

This will open your browser to complete the authentication process and create or link to your Argus ID account.

### 2. Create an Organization

Organizations group related projects and manage team access:

```bash
world organization create
```

This interactive process will guide you through creating your organization.

### 3. Set Up Your Project Repository

Your project needs to be stored in a Git repository for deployment:

```bash
git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Create and Deploy Your Project

Create a project in Forge and deploy it:

```bash
world project create
world deploy
```

This will build your Cardinal shards and deploy to the preview environment.

### 5. Monitor Your Deployment

Check the status and view logs of your deployed project:

```bash
world status
world logs
```

These commands provide real-time monitoring and debugging capabilities for your deployed application.

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development** → Use `world cardinal start` for local development
2. **Version Control** → Commit and push changes to your repository
3. **Preview Deployment** → `world deploy` for testing in preview environment
4. **Production Promotion** → `world promote` when ready for live users
5. **Monitoring** → Use `world status` and `world logs` for ongoing monitoring
