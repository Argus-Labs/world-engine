## Project Overview

Projects are where your World Engine games and applications live. Each project belongs to an organization and can contain multiple Cardinal shards.

## Create a New Project

```bash
world project create
```

The project creation process will guide you through several steps:

### 1. Project Details

- **Project Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your project
- **Project Slug**: Enter a unique identifier for your project

<Warning>
  Project slugs must be unique across all projects within an organization.
</Warning>

### 2. Repository Configuration

- **Repository URL**: The Git repository URL where your project code is hosted
- **Repository Path**: The path within the repository where your World Engine project is located

<Note>
  Your project must be in a Git repository. If you haven't initialized a Git repository yet, do so before creating the project.
</Note>

### 3. Region Selection

Choose the regions where you want to deploy your project. Multiple regions can be selected for global distribution.

### 4. Notification Settings (Optional)

Configure notifications for your project:

- **Discord**: Set up Discord webhook for deployment notifications
- **Slack**: Set up Slack webhook for deployment notifications


## Update Project Configuration

To modify your project settings:

```bash
world project update
```

This allows you to update:
- Project name and slug
- Repository configuration
- Region selection
- Notification settings

## Download a Project

For new team members, you can download a project from your organization:

```bash
world project download
```

This command will:

1. **Select Project**: Choose from available projects in your organization
2. **Choose Download Path**: Specify where to download the project locally
3. **Clone Repository**: Download the project code from the Git repository
4. **Set Up Environment**: Configure the project for local development

<Note>
  You must have access permissions to the project's Git repository to download it successfully.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If you don't have the necessary permissions to the repository, the download will fail. Contact your organization admin to grant you access.
</Warning>

### Prerequisites for Download

Before downloading a project, ensure you have:

- Access to the project's Git repository
- [World CLI installed and authenticated](/quickstart)
- Sufficient disk space for the project
- Git installed on your local machine

## Delete a Project

To remove a project from your organization:
