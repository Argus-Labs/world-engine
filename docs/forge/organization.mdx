## Organization Overview

Organizations in World Engine allow you to group related projects and manage team access. Each organization can contain multiple projects and team members.

## Create a New Organization

```bash
world organization create
```

This interactive command will guide you through the organization creation process:

1. **Organization Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your organization
2. **Organization Slug**: Enter a unique identifier for your organization

<Warning>
  Organization slugs must be unique across all World Engine organizations.
</Warning>


## Invite Members to Your Organization

Once you have created an organization, you can invite team members to collaborate on your projects.

### Invite a User

```bash
world user invite
```

This interactive command will guide you through the invitation process:

1. **User Email**: Enter the email address of the person you want to invite
2. **User Role**: Select the appropriate role for the user

### Available Roles

- **Owner**: Full access to the organization, including deleting the organization
- **Admin**: Can manage projects, invite users, and change user roles
- **Member**: Can view and contribute to projects
- **None**: No access (used for removing permissions)

<Note>
  Only organization owners and admins can invite new members to the organization.
</Note>

### Invite with Specific Role

You can also invite users with a specific role using flags:

```bash
world user invite --email="user@example.com" --role="admin"
```

### Change User Roles

To change an existing user's role in your organization:

```bash
world user role
```

This command allows you to:
- Update a user's role within the organization
- Promote members to admin or owner
- Demote users to member or none

### View Organization Members

To see all members in your organization:

```bash
world organization members
```

This will display:
- All current members
- Their assigned roles
- When they joined the organization
