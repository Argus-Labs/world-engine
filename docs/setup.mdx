## Install dependencies and World CLI

Learn how to install World Engine dependencies and the World CLI.

<Warning>
  **Note**: This assumes that you are using Linux or MacOS. If you are using Windows, we
  recommend you use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run World
  Engine.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="golang" title="Install Go">
        World Engine (WE) is built using [Go](https://golang.org), a performant, easy-to-learn, and expressive
        programming language that is widely used in distributed systems.

        To install Go, follow the instructions on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

        To verify that Go is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        go version
        ```

        **Go beginner tip**: World Engine, combined with the simplicity of Go, makes it easy to get started with
        your game with little to no experience in Go. If this is your first time writing a program in Go,
        we recommend you follow the [Go tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) to familiarize yourself with
        the language. However, you don't need prior Go knowledge to complete this quickstart
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="docker" title="Install Docker">
        World Engine uses [Docker](https://docker.com) to make it easier to develop and deploy your rollup and game in
        any operating system.

        Docker is a containerization tool that allows you to run applications in a sandboxed
        environment; it ensures
        that the World Engine stack will run the same way on your machine as it will on production deployments.

        To install Docker, follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

        To verify that Docker is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        docker version
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Install World CLI ">
        [World CLI](https://github.com/argus-labs/world-cli) is a swiss army knife command-line tool for creating,
        managing, and deploying World Engine projects.

        **Important: World CLI will not work properly without Go and Docker**

        To install World CLI, follow the instructions on the [CLI release page](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/world-cli/releases/).

        **Important**: If you have previously installed World CLI using the install script,
        you need to remove it first by running the following command:

        ```bash
        rm $(which world)
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="planet-ringed" title="Install OrbStack (Optional â€” MacOS only)">
        [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) is a tool that makes it easier to run Docker containers on MacOS. It is not
        required to run World
        Engine, but it is recommended for MacOS users as it provides a better performance and user experience than
        Docker
        Desktop.

        The [Argus Labs](https://argus.gg) team uses OrbStack to develop and build on top of World Engine, and we
        recommend it for MacOS
        users.

        To install OrbStack, follow the instructions on the [OrbStack website](https://orbstack.dev).

## Setup your first World Engine project

<Tip>
  If you're looking for fully functioning examples, you can head over to the [basic
  example](/examples/basic) or [demo game example](/examples/demo-game).
</Tip>

### Scaffold a boilerplate project

<Note>
  This scaffolds the same stack as the [demo game example](/examples/demo-game), minus the client.
</Note>

Once you have World CLI installed, you can scaffold your first World Engine stack by running the following command
in your terminal:

```bash
world setup
```

<img className="block" src="/images/world-setup.png" alt="CLI: world setup" />

<Warning>
    **Troubleshooting**

    If you encountered `Error: dependency check "Docker daemon is running" failed`, make sure that you have
    installed Docker and have Docker Desktop or OrbStack running.

</Warning>

### Start World Engine stack

Once you have scaffolded your project, you can start World Engine stack by running the following
command from your project directory in your terminal:

```bash
world cardinal start
```
To stop the World Engine Stack you can run the following
command from your project directory in your terminal:
```bash
world cardinal stop
```
To clean up your docker images you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
world cardinal purge
```

<Check>
  Once that's up and running, you can start integrating your client using one of our [client
  SDKs](/client/introduction).
