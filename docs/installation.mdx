## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your local machine has the following installed:

- **Go**:

    World Engine games are written in [Go](https://go.dev). This guide requires a minimum Go version of **`v1.25.4`**. To check that Go is installed on your computer, run `go version`.

- **Docker**:

  The World Engine development server runs several local services inside containers. Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) to install Docker.

<Tip>
  Alternatively, you can also use other Docker-compatible container runtimes. We recommend [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) for macOS users and [Podman](https://podman.io/) for Linux users.

## Installing World CLI

The World CLI is the command-line tool for creating, managing, and deploying World Engine projects.

To install the latest version:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MacOS / Linux">
    ```bash
    curl install.world.dev/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    iwr install.world.dev/install.ps1 -useb | iex
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating a Project

Now you are ready to create a new World Engine project. The `setup` command will launch an interactive tool to help you configure your project:

```bash
world setup my-game
```

When prompted, select the **Basic** template.

  TODO: Add an updated image of the selection UI
</Danger>

Once the project has been created, you can start the local development server:

```bash
cd my-game
world start
```

This command builds the game server and runs the World Engine stack. It will take some time during your first run to download the required container images.

## Stopping the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server, or run `world stop` from another terminal.

To reset the world state, run `world purge`. This removes all game data and restores the world to a clean state, which is useful when you want to start fresh during development.
