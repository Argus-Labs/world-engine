# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with building a Cardinal game shard is via the [starter-game-template](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template). To get the template, run the following command in your preferred development directory:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template
```

## Anatomy of the Starter Game Template

The starter game template has 2 directories, but you will only need to worry about the cardinal directory.

- [cardinal](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template/tree/main/cardinal): code for your game server.
- [testsuite](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template/tree/main/testsuite): e2e tests for the whole stack.

### Cardinal

Cardinal is where the game logic lives. We recommend the following directory structure to organize your code:

- `component`: component definitions
- `system`: system functions implementations
- `query`: query implementations for your game state (used by external clients)
- `tx`: transaction definitions

The starter game template comes with some existing code in these directories, so you can get a feel for how things should be organized and implemented.

### Nakama

Nakama is where the relayer and account abstraction layer lives. We expect most people to use our version of Nakama,
which comes with a few benefits:

- Automatically set up RPC endpoints for game clients to hook into the Cardinal game world
- Handle account abstraction and persona tags (similar to gamer-tags)
- Allows for account authentication using a third party account such as Google, Facebook, or Steam
- Allows for non-chain interactions with backend Cardinal systems for easy testing and development

### Docker Compose

The starter-game-template contains a [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration that can run several cardinal related services locally.

- cardinal: The aforementioned cardinal based game server
- nakama: A pre-build Nakama image that can communicate with the game server
- postgres: The storage layer that Nakama depends on
- redis: The storage layer that Cardinal depends on
- testsuite: Some sample integration tests that verify Nakama and Cardinal are communicating correctly
