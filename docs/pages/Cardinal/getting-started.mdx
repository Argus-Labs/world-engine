# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with building a Cardinal game shard is via the [world-cli](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/world-cli)

## Installing World CLI

```zsh
curl https://install.world.dev/cli! | bash
```

Verify installation was successful:

```zsh
world version
```

Verify dependencies are installed:

```zsh
world doctor
```

## Creating a Cardinal Game Shard

```zsh
world cardinal create
```

This will clone the `starter-game-template` in the directory of your game shard name.

The `cardinal` directory is where the game logic lives. It contains the following sub-directories:

- `component`: component definitions
- `system`: system functions implementations
- `query`: query implementations for your game state (used by external clients)
- `msg`: message definitions

The `starter-game-template` comes with some existing code in these directories, so you can get a feel for how things should be organized and implemented.

## Starting the Game Shard

```zsh
world cardinal dev
```

This will start the game shard in development mode, allowing you to interact with your game shard locally.


## Stopping the Game Shard

```zsh
world cardinal stop
```

## Resetting the State

If you need a clean reset of state for your game shard, run:

```zsh
world cardinal purge
```

## Running the EVM Base Shard

To start the EVM base shard with a local celestia DA layer, run:

```zsh
world evm start --dev
```

To shut down the stack, run:

```zsh
world evm stop
```
