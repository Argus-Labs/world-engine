# Cardinal Query Language

## Language Description

CQL (Cardinal Query Language) is a simple query language that queries entities based on components contained in the entity.

### Components

import Link from 'next/link'

The language uses the names of <Link href="/Cardinal/API-Reference/Components">Components</Link> to specify the entities you are interested in querying.

Examples:

* healthComponent
* attackComponent
* armComponent
* legComponent

### Functions

Two functions are provided in the language that accept a variadic amount of components as parameters

`EXACT(…) and CONTAINS(…)`

#### CONTAINS(...)

`CONTAINS` is a query for entities that only need to "contain" the specified components. If an entity has more components than just the specified component(s), it is still a valid entity for that query.

Examples:

- `CONTAINS(armComponent)` is a query for all entities that have a arm component. The entity can have more components than just the arm.
- `CONTAINS(armComponent, legComponent)` is query for all entities that have both an arm component and a leg component. The entity can have more components than the arm and the leg.

#### EXACT(...)

`EXACT` is a query for entities that contain "exactly" the specified the components. Nothing more nothing less.

Examples:

- `EXACT(healthComponent)` is a query for all entities with exactly one health component; nothing more.
- `EXACT(healthComponent, attackComponent)` is a query for all entities with exactly one health component and one attack component; nothing more.

### Operators

CQL provides three logical operators: `&`, `|` and `!`

`!` negates a query.
- Example: `!CONTAINS(healthComponent)` queries all entities that do not contain a health component.

`&` performs the "and" operation on two queries.
- Example: `CONTAINS(healthComponent) & !CONTAINS(attackComponent)` is a query for all entities that contain a health component "and" does not contain an attack component

`|` performs the "or" operation on two queries.
- Example: `CONTAINS(healthComponent) | !CONTAINS(attackComponent)` is a query for all entities that either contains a health component "or" does not contain an attack component

Operators in CQL do not have any intrinsic precedence. All expressions are consumed from left to right.
- Example: `A & B | C & D | F`  is equivalent to `( ( A & B ) | C ) & D ) | F)`

You can use parenthesis to specify and change precedence in CQL.
- Example: `EXACT(legComponent) | (!CONTAIN(healthComponent) & !CONTAIN(attackComponent))`
  - The above is a query for either an entity with only a leg component or an entity that does not have a health component and also does not have an attack component.

- Example: `(EXACT(legComponent) | !CONTAIN(healthComponent)) & !CONTAIN(attackComponent)`
  - The above is the same query but with precedence changed. Now it is querying an entity with either exactly one leg component or does not have a have a health component. Additionally that entity must not ever contain a attack component.
