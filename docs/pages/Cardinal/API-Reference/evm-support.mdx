# EVM Support

Transactions and Reads can be sent from smart contracts in the EVM. This is by an opt-in basis, so you'll need to pass in the corresponding option when instantiating your transactions and reads to enable EVM support.

## Supported Types

Below are the Go types available to use in struct fields when utilizing the `EVMSupport` options.

- []byte (resolves to `bytes` in ABI encoding)
- string
- bool
- int8 - int64
- uint8 - uint64
- github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common.Address (resolves to `address` in ABI encoding)
- *math/big.Int (resolves to a specified int or uint above 64 bits i.e. uint128)

Additionally, slices of all the above types work as well.

<Callout type={"warning"}>
    When using `*big.Int`, you MUST use a special "evm" struct tag to indicate which underlying evm integer type you want to resolve to. This is due to go-ethereum using `*big.Int` for any uint or int greater than 64 bits.
</Callout>

Example:
```go
type Foo struct {
    Num *big.Int `evm:"uint256"`
}
```
