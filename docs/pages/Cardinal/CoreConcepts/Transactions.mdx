# Transactions

Transactions in Cardinal define the types of messages that can be sent from a game client and be processed in
systems. To create a Cardinal transaction type, you must first define the transaction input and output. Both of
these are just normal Go structs.

```go
type PickUpItemInput struct {
	ItemID uint64
}

type PickUpItemOutput struct {
	Success bool
}
```

Then create the Cardinal transaction type using the `NewTransactionType` function in the ecs package. Note, this
function takes a `name` argument. The name passed into the transaction gets used as the endpoint on the game server
to execute this transaction. For example, if the transaction passed in was "foo-bar", the resulting endpoint would
be `address:port/tx/foo-bar` (TODO: update this after we finalize how we want to handle endpoints)

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"


var PickUpTransaction = ecs.NewTransactionType[PickUpItemInput, PickupItemOutput]("pick-up-item")
```
