# Systems

Systems are the functions that are run every tick. Systems must adhere to the following function signature:

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"

func SomeSystem(*ecs.World, *ecs.TransactionQueue) error
```

Systems give you a reference to the world, as well as the transaction queue. This allows you to access any transaction currently queued for this tick, as well as update any component state.

## Getting Transactions

In order to get specific transactions from the queue, utilize the transaction's `In` method. This transaction method takes the queue as an argument, and returns a slice of `TxData`, which contains data related to that transaction.

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"

func SomeSystem(world *ecs.World, queue *ecs.TransactionQueue) error {
    txs := SomeTx.In(queue)
}
```
## TxData

```go
type TxData[In any] struct {
    ID    transaction.TxID
    Value In
    Sig   *sign.SignedPayload
}
```

The ID is a unique ID for the transaction. If you come from a blockchain background, you can think of this as the transaction hash.

The value is the underlying transaction struct.

Sig contains signature information, like the persona tag of the player that sent the transaction.
