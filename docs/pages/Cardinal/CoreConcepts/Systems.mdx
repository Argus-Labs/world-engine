# Systems

Systems are the functions that are run every tick. Systems must adhere to the following function signature:

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"

func SomeSystem(*ecs.World, *ecs.TransactionQueue) error
```

Systems give you a reference to the world, as well as the transaction queue. This allows you to access any transaction currently queued for this tick, as well as update any component state.

## Getting Transactions

In order to get specific transactions from the queue, utilize the transaction's `In` method. This transaction method takes the queue as an argument, and returns a slice of that transaction's data.

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"

func SomeSystem(world *ecs.World, queue *ecs.TransactionQueue) error {
    txs := SomeTx.In(queue)
}
```
