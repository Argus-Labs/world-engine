# Systems

Systems are the functions that are run every tick. Systems must adhere to the following function signature:

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"

func SomeSystem(*ecs.World, *ecs.TransactionQueue) error { return nil }
```

## Transaction Queue

The transaction queue passed into systems contains all transactions that were queued for this tick.
