# Components

Components are the structures that give entities their state. In Cardinal, you define your component using a normal Go
struct.

```go
type Health struct {
    Amount  uint64
    Cap     uint64
}
```

In order to use this struct in the ECS world, instantiate a new component type, passing your struct in the type
parameter.

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"

var (
	 HealthComponent = ecs.NewComponentType[Health]()
)

```

## Options

The `NewComponentType` function accepts Options to alter the component.

### WithDefault
`WithDefault` allows entities with this component to be instantiated with a default value, rather than the zero value of the struct.
If you are not familiar with Go's zero values, check out this [article](https://www.scaler.com/topics/golang/golang-zero-values/).

```go
import "github.com/argus-labs/world-engine/cardinal/ecs"

type Health struct {
    Amount  uint64
    Cap     uint64
}

var (
	 HealthComponent = ecs.NewComponentType[Health](ecs.WithDefault(Health{Amount: 100, Cap: 100})
)
```

The above code would start every entity with the `HealthComponent` attached to it at full health, instead of zero.
