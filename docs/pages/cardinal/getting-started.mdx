# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with building a game shard is via the [starter-game-template](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template). To use this, simply run the following command in your preferred development directory:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template
```
