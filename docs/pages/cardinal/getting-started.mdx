# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with building a Cardinal game shard is via the
[starter-game-template](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template). To the template, simply run the following
command in your preferred development directory:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template
```

## Anatomy of the Starter Game Template

The game template has 4 directories, but you will only need to worry about 2 of them (cardinal and nakama).

- `cardinal`: code for your game server.
- `magefiles`: utility scripts that utilize the `mage` build tool (an alternative to `make`)
- `nakama`: code for the relayer/account abstraction layer.
- `testsuite`: e2e tests for the whole stack.

### Cardinal

Cardinal is where the game logic lives. We recommend the following directory structure to organize your code:

- `component`: component definitions
- `system`: system functions implementations
- `read`: read (query) implementations for your game state (used by external clients)
- `tx`: transaction definitions

The starter game template comes with some existing code in these directories, so you can get a feel for how things
should be organized and implemented.

### Nakama

Nakama is where the relayer and account abstraction layer lives. We expect most people to use our version of Nakama,
which comes with a few benefits:

- automatically sets up RPC endpoints for game clients to hook into the Cardinal game world
- handles account abstraction and persona tags (similar to gamer-tags)
