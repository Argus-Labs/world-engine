# Meet Cardinal

Cardinal is a powerful game server library that enables the development of fully on-chain games. It follows the ECS
(Entity-Component-System) architecture which facilitates fast and efficient updates to game state. If you are unfamiliar
with ECS concepts, we recommend the following reading: [What is ECS?](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq#what-is-ecs)

Developers building on Cardinal write their code in Go.
