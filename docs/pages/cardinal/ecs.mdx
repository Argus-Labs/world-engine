# Introduction to ECS

Cardinal is a powerful game server library that enables the development of fully on-chain games. It follows the ECS
(Entity-Component-System) architecture which facilitates fast and efficient updates to game state.

ECS, or Entity-Component-System, stands as a programming paradigm specifically tailored for game development. While ECS
itself is conceptually straightforward, its effective implementation demands a nuanced understanding. Familiarizing
yourself with the ECS model is crucial before delving into the capabilities of Cardinal.


### Entities

Entities are simply a unique identifier of something in the game. Entities can be players, objects, NPCs, etc. They are
the simplest unit in the ECS system.

### Components

Components are data fragments that bind to entities, offering descriptive attributes. Imagine a "Health" component for
players, tracking their health status. Maintaining component generality is key â€“ for instance, a health component can be
reused for different types of entities, such as animals or destructible objects.

### Entities, part two

Now that components are understood, let's revisit entities. In the ECS realm, entities aren't conjured from thin air;
they are composed through the combination of one or more components. Consider a fighting game, where a player is
composed of both a "Health" component, quantifying hit points, and an "Attack" component, dictating the inflicted damage
potential.

### Systems

Systems are the heartbeat of ECS, encompassing functions that manipulate entities, allowing your game logic comes to
life. Systems often operate by iteratively traversing specific components and updating their values. For instance, a
"HealthRegen" system could iterate over entities with the "Health" component, progressively replenishing health values.


## Why Do We Need ECS?

When used correctly, ECS unlocks a realm of organized code and seamless extensibility. Injecting new features into
your game can be as straightforward as introducing a novel system that interacts with existing components. It's
important to note that while ECS is a formidable tool, it isn't a universal solution. Certain game scenarios might find
better suited solutions outside the ECS paradigm.
