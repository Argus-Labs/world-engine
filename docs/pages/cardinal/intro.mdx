# Cardinal

Cardinal is the first game shard implementation for the World Engine, designed from the bottom up to make building high-throughput, real-time on-chain games as easy as possible.

## Key Features
- **High-performance game server** - Cardinal is how a blockchain would be constructed if it was designed for games.
  It is designed to function much like a game server, being able to handle hundreds of game moves per second in
real-time.
- **Tick-driven runtime** - Cardinal, like many modern game servers, utilize the concept of a tick to allow developers
to implement complex real-time game logic such as game physics, combat systems, and many more that are difficult to
implement in an event-driven runtime of a typical blockchain.
- **Entity-Component-System Framework** - Cardinal comes with a built-in, in-protocol, ECS framework that allows game
developers to easily manage and extend their game state and logic.
