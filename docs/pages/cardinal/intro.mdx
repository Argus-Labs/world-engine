# Cardinal

Cardinal is the first game shard implementation for the World Engine designed from the bottom-up to make it as
building high-throughput real-time onchain games as easy as possible.

## Key Features
- **High-performance game server** - Cardinal is how a blockchain would look like if it was designed for games.
  It is designed to function much like a game server, being able to handle hundreds of game moves per second in
real-time.
- **Tick-driven runtime** - Cardinal, like any modern game server, utilize the concept of tick to allow developers
to implement complex real-time game logic such as game physics, combat system, and many more that are difficult to
implement in an event-driven runtime of your typical blockchain.
- **Entity-Component-System Framework** - Cardinal comes with a built-in, in-protocol, ECS framework that allow game
developers to manage their game state and logic easily.
