# Nakama

[Nakama](https://heroiclabs.com/nakama/) is an open source server framework geared towards multiplayer experiences. It has a number of different client libraries (such as Unity and Javascript) which makes it easy to implement game clients that interact with Nakama.

Go-based Nakama deployments can be extended by using "shared objects", also known as [plugins](https://pkg.go.dev/plugin).

The [starter-game-template](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/starter-game-template) leverages this shared object pattern to expand on Nakama to better interact with a Cardinal based backend. As you develop your own Cardinal based game, you can use this Nakama plugin to develop and test your game.

This document describes core Nakama concepts that are especially relevant to Cardinal based games, as well as how those concepts are specifically used to support Cardinal.
