Queries are predefined API endpoints that provide access to the game state data and other information that a game client might need.

In Cardinal, queries are defined as a pair of Go structs representing a `Request` and `Response` along with a handler function with the following signature:

```go
func Query(worldCtx cardinal.WorldContext, req *Request) (*Response, error)
```

**Example:**
- A `WorldVars` static query used to provide the client with game constants.
- A `PlayerLocation` query used to provide the client with the location of the player.

## Defining Queries

By convention, queries are defined in the `query` directory with each query definition in its own separate file.

You can easily create a new query and register it to the world by following these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Define the request/response struct and the handler function">
        A query is defined using a pair of Go structs and a handler function. You can write any arbitrary logic in the handler function and access the game state using `cardinal.WorldContext`.

        ```go /query/query_world_vars.go
        type Request struct {
            PlayerName string
        }
    
        type Response struct {
            X int
            Y int
        }
    
        func PlayerLocation(worldCtx cardinal.WorldContext, req *Request) (*Response, error) {
            // Handle WorldVarsRequest -> WorldVarsResponse here
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Register the query in the world">
        Queries must be registered in the world before they can be used. This is done by calling the `RegisterQuery` function and passing in the name of the endpoint and the function handler.

        ```go main.go
        package main

        func main() {
            w, err := cardinal.NewWorld()
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("failed to create world")
            }

            // Register queries
            // NOTE: You must register your queries here for it to be accessible.
            err := cardinal.RegisterQuery[query.WorldVarsRequest, query.WorldVarsResponse](w, "world-vars", query.WorldVars))
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("failed to register query")
            }

            // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
