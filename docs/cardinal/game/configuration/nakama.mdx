### ENABLE_ALLOWLIST

Enables Nakamaâ€™s allowlist feature, which allows for beta keys. This is useful for restricted access to certain parts of the game during development or early access.

**Example**
```
ENABLE_ALLOWLIST = false
```

### OUTGOING_QUEUE_SIZE

**Example**
```
OUTGOING_QUEUE_SIZE = 64
```

### NAKAMA_TRACE_ENABLED

Enables tracing within Nakama, which integrates with external tracing tools such as Jaeger for visualizing system performance.

**Example**
```
NAKAMA_TRACE_ENABLED = true
```

### NAKAMA_METRICS_ENABLED

Enables metrics collection within Nakama, integrating with Prometheus for system metrics tracking.

**Example**
```
NAKAMA_METRICS_ENABLED = true
```

### NAKAMA_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE

Trace sample rate. valid values are between 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. This is a float value.

**Example**
```
NAKAMA_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.6
```

### NAKAMA_METRICS_INTERVAL

Prometheus scraping interval in seconds.

**Example**
```
NAKAMA_METRICS_INTERVAL = 30
```

### NAKAMA_IMAGE

Specifies Nakama Docker image. this will only work on world cli v1.3.3 above.
- For Cardinal v1.7.1 and later, the Nakama image must be `v1.4.0` or later.
- For Cardinal v1.6.x and earlier, the Nakama image must be `v1.2.9` or earlier.
