**Example**
```
NAKAMA_TRACE_ENABLED = true
```

### NAKAMA_METRICS_ENABLED

Enables metrics collection within Nakama, integrating with Prometheus for system metrics tracking.

**Example**
```
NAKAMA_METRICS_ENABLED = true
```

### NAKAMA_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE

Trace sample rate. valid values are between 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. This is a float value.

**Example**
```
NAKAMA_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.6
```

### NAKAMA_METRICS_INTERVAL

Prometheus scraping interval in seconds.
