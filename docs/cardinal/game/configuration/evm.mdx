[evm]
CHAIN_ID = "chain_id"
CHAIN_KEY_MNEMONIC = "chain_key_mnemonic"
DA_AUTH_TOKEN = "da_auth_token"
DA_BASE_URL = "http://celestia-devnet"
DA_NAMESPACE_ID = "defaultnamespace"

```

### CHAIN_ID

A unique identifier representing the blockchain network. This is critical for identifying the correct chain to which the EVM is connected. 
Must be set to the correct chain ID to ensure proper blockchain communication.

**Example**
```
CHAIN_ID = 'world-420'
```

### CHAIN_KEY_MNEMONIC

Mnemonic phrases, also known as seed phrases or recovery phrases, used for generating cryptographic keys for your blockchain wallet.

**Example**
```
CHAIN_KEY_MNEMONIC = 'enact adjust liberty squirrel bulk ticket invest tissue antique window thank slam unknown fury script among bread social switch glide wool clog flag enroll'
```

### DA_AUTH_TOKEN

An authentication token obtained from the Celestia client, which is used to interact with Celestia’s Data Availability layer.

**Example**
```
DA_AUTH_TOKEN = 'ywi27664820'
```

### DA_BASE_URL

The base URL for the Celestia client, which connects the EVM to Celestia’s Data Availability (DA) network.

**Example**
```
DA_BASE_URL = 'http://celestia-devnet'
```

### DA_NAMESPACE_ID

The namespace ID for the Celestia client. This is used to separate data within the DA layer.

**Example**
```
DA_NAMESPACE_ID = '67480c4a88c4d12935d4'
```

### FAUCET_ADDRESS

The Ethereum address (without the leading 0x) to which the faucet sends tokens. This address will receive tokens when the faucet is enabled.

**Example**
```
FAUCET_ADDRESS = 'aa9288F88233Eb887d194fF2215Cf1776a6FEE41'
```

### FAUCET_AMOUNT

The amount of ETH, expressed in wei (the smallest unit of ETH), to be distributed by the faucet. This value is encoded as a hexadecimal.

**Example**
```
FAUCET_AMOUNT = '0x56BC75E2D6310000'  # 100 ETH
```

### FAUCET_ENABLED

Enables or disables the faucet feature, which automatically distributes tokens to the specified address.

**Example**
```
FAUCET_ENABLED = false
```
