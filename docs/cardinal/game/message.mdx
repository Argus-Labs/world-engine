Messages are predefined user action that can be submitted to Cardinal and handled in the next tick within a system. A message is the primary way of representing possible user actions in the game. After a message is execute within a tick, it returns a `Reply` payload that can be read by the game client.

In Cardinal, transactions are defined using a pair of Go structs representing a `Message` and a `Reply`.

**Example:**
- An `AttackPlayerMsg` message may contain the `TargetNickname` of the player you want to attack.
- A `MoveMsg` message may contain the `Direction` and `Distance` of the move.

## Defining Messages

By convention, messages are defined in the `msg` directory in its own separate files.

You can easily create a new message and register it to the world by following these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Define the message and reply struct">
        A message and its reply is defined as a Go struct. You also need to create a singleton message object using the `NewMessageType` function. 

        ```go /msg/msg_attack_player.go
        package msg
        
        type AttackPlayerMsg struct {
            TargetNickname string
        }

        type AttackPlayerMsgReply struct {
            Damage int
        }

        var AttackPlayer = cardinal.NewMessageType[AttackPlayerMsg, AttackPlayerMsgReply]("attack-player")
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Register the message in main.go">
        Messages must be registered in the world before they can be used. This is done by calling the `RegisterMessages` function.

        ```go main.go
        package main

        func main() {
            w, err := cardinal.NewWorld()
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("failed to create world")
            }
    
            // Register messages (user action)
            // NOTE: You must register your transactions here for it to be executed.
            err := cardinal.RegisterMessages(w,
                msg.CreatePlayer,
                msg.AttackPlayer,
            )
            if err != nil {
                log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("failed to register message")
            }
    
            // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
