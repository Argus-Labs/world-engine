title: 'Cardinal Query Language (CQL)'
---

CQL (Cardinal Query Language) is a simple query language that provides an easy way to access the game state without having to write a custom [Query](/cardinal/game/query).

You can use it by making a POST request to the `/query/game/cql` with the CQL query. See the [REST API documentation](/cardinal/rest/query-game-cql) for more information.

## Querying Entities

CQL allows you to use the name of [Components](/cardinal/game/component) to specify the entities you want to query in Cardinal.

For example, let's say you have the following component definition:

```go
package component

type Health struct {
    Current int
    Max int
}

func (Health) Name() string {
    return "Health"
}

type Attack struct {
    Damage int
}

func (Attack) Name() string {
    return "Attack"
}
```

You can query all entities that have a health and attack component by using the following query:

```
CONTAINS(Health, Attack)
```

## Functions

Two functions are provided in the language that accept a variadic amount of components as parameters: `EXACT(…) and CONTAINS(…)`

### EXACT(...)

`EXACT` is a query for entities that contain "exactly" the specified the components. Nothing more nothing less.

**Examples:**

- `EXACT(healthComponent)` is a query for all entities with exactly one health component; nothing more.
- `EXACT(healthComponent, attackComponent)` is a query for all entities with exactly one health component and one attack component; nothing more.


### CONTAINS(...)

`CONTAINS` is a query for entities that only need to "contain" the specified components. If an entity has more components than just the specified component(s), it is still a valid entity for that query.

**Examples:**

- `CONTAINS(armComponent)` is a query for all entities that have an arm component. The entity can have more components than just the arm.
- `CONTAINS(armComponent, legComponent)` is query for all entities that have both an arm component and a leg component. The entity can have more components than the arm and the leg.


## Logical Operators

CQL provides three logical operators: `!` (not), `&` (and), and `|` (or).

**NOT (!)**

`!` negates a query.
- Example: `!CONTAINS(healthComponent)` queries all entities that do not contain a health component.

**AND (&)**

`&` performs the "and" operation on two queries.
- Example: `CONTAINS(healthComponent) & !CONTAINS(attackComponent)` is a query for all entities that contain a health component "and" does not contain an attack component

**OR (|)**

`|` performs the "or" operation on two queries.
- Example: `CONTAINS(healthComponent) | !CONTAINS(attackComponent)` is a query for all entities that either contains a health component "or" does not contain an attack component

### Operator Precedence

Operators in CQL do not have any intrinsic precedence. All expressions are consumed from left to right.
- Example: `A & B | C & D | F`  is equivalent to `( ( A & B ) | C ) & D ) | F)`

You can use parenthesis to specify and change precedence in CQL.
- Example: `EXACT(legComponent) | (!CONTAINS(healthComponent) & !CONTAINS(attackComponent))`
- The above is a query for either an entity with only a leg component or an entity that does not have a health component and also does not have an attack component.

- Example: `(EXACT(legComponent) | !CONTAINS(healthComponent)) & !CONTAINS(attackComponent)`
- The above is the same query but with precedence changed. Now it is querying an entity with either exactly one leg component or does not have a health component. Additionally that entity must not ever contain an attack component.
