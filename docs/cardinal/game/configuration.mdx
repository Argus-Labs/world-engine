This page assumes you are using the [World CLI](https://github.com/Argus-Labs/world-cli) to  manage your Cardinal project.

Projects using the World ClI come with a file, called `world.toml`. The following table explains the values and requirements of the toml file for each section.



## Cardinal
| Name                         | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Required for Production |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| CARDINAL_NAMESPACE           | The name of your cardinal game shard. If you are running multiple game shards in a single World Engine instance, this MUST be unique.                            | YES                     |
| CARDINAL_MODE                | The cardinal mode determines how your game shard runs. In development, it will not submit any transactions to the base shard, and security concerns are lowered. | N/A                     |
| REDIS_ADDRESS                | The address of the redis instance.                                                                                                                               | YES                     |
| REDIS_PASSWORD               | The password of your redis instance.                                                                                                                             | YES                     |
| CARDINAL_LOG_LEVEL           | The level of logging Cardinal should output. See (Leveled Logging)[https://github.com/rs/zerolog?tab=readme-ov-file#leveled-logging] for more details.           | NO                      |
| BASE_SHARD_SEQUENCER_ADDRESS | The address of your EVM Base Shard deployment. This will typically be running on port 9601.                                                                      | YES                     |

## EVM Base Shard
| Name            | Description                                                                                                                                              |

| DA_NAMESPACE_ID | The namespace the EVM will post its blobs under. Learn more about DA namespaces here [Namespaces](https://celestia.org/glossary/namespaced-merkle-tree/) |                                                                                                                 |

| BLOCK_TIME      | The interval at which the EVM Base Shard should produce blocks.                                                                                          |
