title: Search for Entities with Components
description: How to search for entities with components in Cardinal
---

**Search** is an important concept in Cardinal, it allows you to:

- Create entities
- Find entities with specific components

## Defining a Search

Start by defining the search, this is done in your system state struct. By convention, we put searches
in the `system/shared.go` file.

```go system/shared.go highlight={8-13}
package system

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/demo-game/component"
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/ecs"
)

// ecs.Exact or ecs.Contains (explained in Match Types below)
type PlayerSearch = ecs.Contains[struct {
	Tag      ecs.Ref[component.PlayerTag]
	Position ecs.Ref[component.Position]
}]

// … other searches
```

## Using a Search

### Creating Entities

We have a specific page on [creating entities](/cardinal/build/system/entity).

### Iterating Over Entities

You can use the `PlayerSearch` to search for entities with the `PlayerTag` and `Position` components.

```go system/example_player_system.go highlight={9,13}
package system

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
)

type PlayerSystemState struct {
	cardinal.BaseSystemState
	Players PlayerSearch
}

func PlayerSystem(state *PlayerSystemState) error {
	for entity, player := range state.Players.Iter() {
		tag := player.Tag.Get()
		position := player.Position.Get()

		state.Logger().Info().Msgf("Player %s is at %d, %d", tag.Nickname, position.X, position.Y)
	}
	return nil
}
```

## Match Types

| Match Type     | Description                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ecs.Contains` | Entity must have **at least** these components |
| `ecs.Exact`    | Entity must have **exactly** these components  |

### `ecs.Contains`

Returns entities that contain **at least** the specified components (they may have additional components):

```go system/example_contains.go
type PlayerSearch = ecs.Exact[struct {
	Tag      ecs.Ref[component.PlayerTag]
	Position ecs.Ref[component.Position]
}]
```

**Behavior**:

- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position, Health]` → ✅ Match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position]` → ✅ Match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag]` → ❌ No match

### `ecs.Exact`

Returns entities that contain **exactly** the specified components (no more, no less):

```go system/example_exact.go
type PlayerSearch = ecs.Exact[struct {
	Tag      ecs.Ref[component.PlayerTag]
	Position ecs.Ref[component.Position]
}]
```

**Behavior**:

- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position, Health]` → ❌ No match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position]` → ✅ Match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag]` → ❌ No match

<Note>
  **ECS Concept**: These match types reflect Entity Component System (ECS) patterns. `ecs.Contains`
  is useful for finding entities by their capabilities, while `ecs.Exact` is useful for finding
  entities with a specific component combination.
