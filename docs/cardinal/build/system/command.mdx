title: Handling Commands
description: How to create and handle commands in Cardinal
---

Commands are how players interact with your game world. They represent actions that players
want to perform, such as moving, attacking, or chatting.

Commands are sent by the client, with payload shape pre-defined in the command struct.

## Defining Commands

All commands must embed `cardinal.BaseCommand` and implement the `Name()` method.
By convention, commands are defined in the **system** in which they are used.

```go system/player_move.go
package system

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
)

type MovePlayerCommand struct {
	cardinal.BaseCommand
	// The payload of the command.
	X uint32 `json:"x"`
	Y uint32 `json:"y"`
}

func (MovePlayerCommand) Name() string {
	// The name of the command. Clients specify the name when sending the command.
	return "move-player"
}
```

## Handling Commands

Commands are handled in systems using the `WithCommand` field.

```go system/player_move.go highlight={21,26-34} focus={19-36}
package system

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
)

type MovePlayerCommand struct {
	cardinal.BaseCommand
	// The payload of the command.
	X uint32 `json:"x"`
	Y uint32 `json:"y"`
}

func (MovePlayerCommand) Name() string {
	// The name of the command. Clients specify the name when sending the command.
	return "move-player"
}

type MovePlayerSystemState struct {
	cardinal.BaseSystemState
	MovePlayerCommands cardinal.WithCommand[MovePlayerCommand]
	Players            PlayerSearch
}

func MovePlayerSystem(state *MovePlayerSystemState) error {
	// Iterate over all move-player commands received in the tick.
	for cmd := range state.MovePlayerCommands.Iter() {
		payload := cmd.Payload()
		state.Logger().Info().Msgf("Player moved to %d, %d", payload.X, payload.Y)

		// You can also access the persona associated with the command.
		persona := cmd.Persona()
		state.Logger().Info().Msgf("Command sent by persona %s", persona)
	}
	return nil
}
```

<Tip>
  Simply logging commands isn't very useful. You can [create/destroy
  entities](/cardinal/build/system/entity), [get/set components](/cardinal/build/system/component),
  or as you'll learn in the next page, [send events](/cardinal/build/system/event).
