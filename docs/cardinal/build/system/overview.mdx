**Systems** (the "S" in ECS) contain game logic that act on **entities** with the desired **components**. For example:

- A physics system acts on all entities that have a mass and position component
- A regen system acts on all entities that have a health component
- A player movement system acts on all entities that have a position component

## Registering Systems

Before your systems can run, you need to register them with the world using `cardinal.RegisterSystem()`.

```go
func main() {
    world := cardinal.NewWorld()

    // Spawn player at tick 0 (only once)
    cardinal.RegisterSystem(world, system.PlayerSpawnerSystem, cardinal.WithHook(cardinal.Init))

    // Register player movement system (runs every tick)
    cardinal.RegisterSystem(world, system.PlayerMoveSystem)

    world.StartGame()
}
```

Systems can be registered with different hooks to control **when** they execute during the game loop.

| Hook                                     | When it runs                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cardinal.WithHook(cardinal.Init)`       | Once during world initialization (only **once at tick 0**), before any game loop starts        |
| `cardinal.WithHook(cardinal.PreUpdate)`  | Every tick, **before** the main update phase                                                   |
| `cardinal.WithHook(cardinal.Update)`     | Every tick, **during** the main update phase (this is the **default** if no hook is specified) |
| `cardinal.WithHook(cardinal.PostUpdate)` | Every tick, **after** the main update phase                                                    |
