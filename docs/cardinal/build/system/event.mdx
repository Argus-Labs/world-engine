description: How to emit events and system events in Cardinal
---

Events provide a way for Cardinal to communicate state changes and important occurrences to clients / other systems in real-time.

- **Notifications**: Messages about what happened in the game
- **Reactive**: Allow clients to respond to game state changes
- **Real-Time**: Published immediately after game tick processing
- **Typed**: Strongly typed for safety and clarity

## Types of Events

- **Events**: Published to clients
- **System Events**: Published to other systems within Cardinal

## Events

Events that are published to clients, for example:

- **Player Actions**: Movement, combat, item usage
- **World Changes**: Environmental updates, state changes
- **Social Events**: Chat messages, player interactions

By convention, events are defined in the `event` directory. These events must embed `cardinal.BaseEvent`
and implement the `Name()` method.

The following example shows a simple event that is emitted when a player moves, so other players can see the movement.

```go event/event.go
package event

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
)

type PlayerMovement struct {
	cardinal.BaseEvent
	// The payload of the event.
	Nickname string `json:"nickname"`
	X        uint32 `json:"x"`
	Y        uint32 `json:"y"`
}

func (PlayerMovement) Name() string {
	// The name of the event. Clients specify the name when subscribing to the event.
	return "player-movement"
}
```

### Emitting Events

You can use the event by creating a `WithEvent` field in your system state, then emitting the event using the `Emit` method.

<Tip>
  This example shows emitting an event as part of a command handler, however events can be emitted
  from any system, e.g. when a player dies, a monster spawns, etc.
</Tip>

```go system/player_move.go highlight={23,44-48} focus={20-52}
package system

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/demo-game/component"
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/demo-game/event"
)

type MovePlayerCommand struct {
	cardinal.BaseCommand
	Nickname string `json:"nickname"`
	X        uint32 `json:"x"`
	Y        uint32 `json:"y"`
}

func (a MovePlayerCommand) Name() string {
	return "move-player"
}

type MovePlayerSystemState struct {
	cardinal.BaseSystemState
	MovePlayerCommands  cardinal.WithCommand[MovePlayerCommand]
	PlayerMovementEvent cardinal.WithEvent[event.PlayerMovement]
	Players             PlayerSearch
}

func MovePlayerSystem(state *MovePlayerSystemState) error {
	// This is a contrived example for demonstration purposes.
	// In a real implementation, you would want to avoid the nested loop
	// by using a more efficient lookup mechanism (e.g., a map or index).

	// Iterate over all move-player commands received in the tick.
	for msg := range state.MovePlayerCommands.Iter() {
		// Iterate over all players in the state.
		for entity, player := range state.Players.Iter() {
			tag := player.Tag.Get()

			if msg.Nickname != tag.Nickname {
				continue
			}

			player.Position.Set(component.Position{X: int(msg.X), Y: int(msg.Y)})

			state.PlayerMovementEvent.Emit(event.PlayerMovement{
				Nickname: tag.Nickname,
				X:           msg.X,
				Y:           msg.Y,
			})
		}
	}
	return nil
}
```

### Receiving Events

To receive events on your client, you can use one of the client SDKs that we have. Here's an example of how to [subscribe
to events using the JavaScript SDK](/javascript/guides/subscribe-events).

## System Events

Events for communication between systems:

- **Cross-System**: Share data between different systems
- **Lifecycle**: Entity creation/destruction notifications
- **Triggers**: Activate secondary game logic

By convention, system events are defined in the `system_event` directory. Unlike events, system events doesn't need to
embed `cardinal.BaseEvent`.

The following example shows a system event that creates a grave when a player is attacked and dies.

```go system_event/system_event.go
package systemevent

type PlayerDeath struct {
	Nickname string
}

func (PlayerDeath) Name() string {
	return "player-death"
}
```

### Emitting System Events

You can use the system event by creating a `WithSystemEventEmitter` field in your system state, then emitting it
using the `Emit` method.

```go system/player_attack.go highlight={22,46} focus={19-51}
package system

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/basic/component"
	systemevent "github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/basic/system_event"
)

type AttackPlayerCommand struct {
	cardinal.BaseCommand
	Target string
	Damage uint32
}

func (a AttackPlayerCommand) Name() string {
	return "attack-player"
}

type AttackPlayerSystemState struct {
	cardinal.BaseSystemState
	AttackPlayerCommands    cardinal.WithCommand[AttackPlayerCommand]
	PlayerDeathSystemEvents cardinal.WithSystemEventEmitter[systemevent.PlayerDeath]
	Players                 PlayerSearch
}

func AttackPlayerSystem(state *AttackPlayerSystemState) error {
	// This is a contrived example for demonstration purposes.
	// In a real implementation, you would want to avoid the nested loop
	// by using a more efficient lookup mechanism (e.g., a map or index).

	// Iterate over all attack-player commands received in the tick.
	for msg := range state.AttackPlayerCommands.Iter() {
		// Iterate over all players in the state.
		for entity, player := range state.Players.Iter() {
			tag := player.Tag.Get()

			if msg.Target != tag.Nickname {
				continue
			}

			newHealth := player.Health.Get().HP - int(msg.Damage)
			if newHealth > 0 {
				player.Health.Set(component.Health{HP: newHealth})
			} else {
				entity.Destroy()
				state.PlayerDeathSystemEvents.Emit(systemevent.PlayerDeath{Nickname: tag.Nickname})
			}
		}
	}
	return nil
}
```

### Receiving System Events

To receive system events, create a `WithSystemEventReceiver` field in your system state, then iterate over the emitted system events.

```go system/graveyard.go highlight={11,17}
package system

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/basic/component"
	systemevent "github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/basic/system_event"
)

type GraveyardSystemState struct {
	cardinal.BaseSystemState
	PlayerDeathSystemEvents cardinal.WithSystemEventReceiver[systemevent.PlayerDeath]
	Graves                  GraveSearch
}

func GraveyardSystem(state *GraveyardSystemState) error {
	// Iterate over all player-death system events received in the tick.
	for event := range state.PlayerDeathSystemEvents.Iter() {
		_, _ = state.Graves.Create(component.Gravestone{Nickname: event.Nickname})
	}
	return nil
}
```
