description: How to create and manage your Cardinal world
---

In Cardinal, the `main.go` file is used as the entry point for your game shard implementation. This is where you will initialize your world and register your component, message, query, and system to it.

## Example

A typical `main.go` file will look like this:

```go main.go
package main

import (
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal"
	"github.com/argus-labs/monorepo/pkg/cardinal/examples/demo-game/system"
)

func main() {
	world := cardinal.NewWorld()

	// Example of using a hook. This hook runs before the main update phase.
	// There are also other hooks:
	// - Init (runs only once, at tick 0)
	// - PreUpdate (runs before the main update phase)
	// - Update (runs during the main update phase)
	// - PostUpdate (runs after the main update phase)
	cardinal.RegisterSystem(world, system.PlayerSetUpdater, cardinal.WithHook(cardinal.PreUpdate))

	cardinal.RegisterSystem(world, system.PlayerSpawnSystem)
	cardinal.RegisterSystem(world, system.MovePlayerSystem)
	cardinal.RegisterSystem(world, system.PlayerLeaveSystem)
	cardinal.RegisterSystem(world, system.OnlineStatusUpdater)

	world.StartGame()
}
```
