description: How to query the Cardinal state from your clients
---

The Query API provides your clients access to the Cardinal state. Unlike commands, queries are read-only and retrieve
information about entities, components, and world state.

- **Read-Only**: Never modify game state
- **Real-Time**: Reflect current world state
- **Flexible**: Support complex filtering and searching
- **Efficient**: Optimized for fast data retrieval

Example of a query:

```json Basic Query
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag", "Health"],
  "match": "contains",
  "where": "Health.HP > 50"
}
```

## Query Structure

Queries consist of three main parts:

### Find

Specify which components to search for:

- **Component Names**: List of component types to match
- **Case Sensitive**: Component names must match exactly

### Match

How to match components:

- **"exact"**: Entity must have exactly these components
- **"contains"**: Entity must have at least these components

#### Match Type: Contains

Returns entities that contain **at least** the specified components (they may have additional components):

```json Match Type: Contains
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag", "Position"],
  "match": "contains"
}
```

**Behavior**:

- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position, Health]` → ✅ Match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position]` → ✅ Match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag]` → ❌ No match

#### Match Type: Exact

Returns entities that contain **exactly** the specified components (no more, no less):

```json Match Type: Exact
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag", "Position"],
  "match": "exact"
}
```

**Behavior**:

- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position, Health]` → ❌ No match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag, Position]` → ✅ Match
- Entity with `[PlayerTag]` → ❌ No match

<Note>
  **ECS Concept**: These match types reflect Entity Component System (ECS) patterns. `contains` is
  useful for finding entities by their capabilities, while `exact` is useful for finding entities
  with a specific component combination.
</Note>

### Where Clause (Optional)

Filter results using expression language. The `where` field uses the
[Expr expression language](https://expr-lang.org/), which provides:

- **Comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- **Logical operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- **Membership testing**: `in`, `not in`
- **Built-in functions**: `len()`, `all()`, `any()`, `filter()`, `map()`

**Examples**:

- **Comparisons**: `Health.HP > 100`
- **Logic**: `PlayerTag.Level >= 10 && Health.HP > 50`
- **String Operations**: `PlayerTag.Nickname contains "admin"`

#### Where Clause Examples

```json By Online Status
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag", "OnlineStatus"],
  "match": "contains",
  "where": "OnlineStatus.Online == true"
}
```

```json By Name
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag", "Position"],
  "match": "contains",
  "where": "PlayerTag.Name == \"Alice\""
}
```

```json By Nickname
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag"],
  "match": "contains",
  "where": "PlayerTag.Nickname contains \"admin\""
}
```

```json By Online Status and Position
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag", "Position", "OnlineStatus"],
  "match": "contains",
  "where": "Position.X > 100 && Position.Y < 200 && OnlineStatus.Online == true"
}
```

```json By PlayerTag ID
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag"],
  "match": "contains",
  "where": "PlayerTag.ID in [\"user1\", \"user2\", \"user3\"]"
}
```

```json By Nickname Length and Position
{
  "find": ["PlayerTag", "Position"],
  "match": "contains",
  "where": "len(PlayerTag.Nickname) > 5 && Position.X + Position.Y < 500"
}
```
