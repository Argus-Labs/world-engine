description: How to create and use components in Cardinal
---

Components (the "C" in ECS) are the data attributes attached to entities. By convention, components in
Cardinal are defined in the **component** directory.

```go component/playertag.go
package component

type PlayerTag struct {
	Nickname string `json:"nickname"`
}

func (PlayerTag) Name() string {
	return "playertag"
}
```

There's no need to register components manually. As long as your component is accessed by one or more systems,
it will be registered automatically.
