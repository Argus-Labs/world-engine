<Warning>
    This guide assumes that you have completed the [Quickstart](/quickstart) guide and have World CLI installed. If you have not, please complete that guide first.
</Warning>

## Run Cardinal + Nakama

To run your Cardinal game shard together with Nakama, you need to run the following command:

```bash
world cardinal start
```

<Warning>
    When integrating using Nakama, do not use `world cardinal dev`. This command will run Cardinal game shard without Nakama.
</Warning>

By default, Nakama's http port will be running on `7350`. This will be the port that your game client will need to connect to for integration.
