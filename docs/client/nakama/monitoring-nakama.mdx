  from version v1.3.1.

## Enabling Monitoring

You can enable this feature, run the following command:

```bash
world cardinal start --telemetry
```

By default this will start both the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) containers.

You can access the Jaeger Web UI at `http://localhost:16686`:
