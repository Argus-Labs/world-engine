<Note>
  The Jaeger and Prometheus integration requires World CLI v1.3.1 or higher.
</Note>

## Enabling Monitoring

To enable this feature, run the following command:

```bash
world cardinal start --telemetry
```

By default, this will start both the [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) and
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) containers.

You can access the Jaeger Web UI at `http://localhost:16686`:

And the Prometheus Web UI at `http://localhost:9090`:

## Configuration

You can configure some of the behavior of Jaeger and Prometheus by editing your
`world.toml` file. Currently, only these options are supported:

**Example configuration**:

```toml
[nakama]
NAKAMA_TRACE_ENABLED = true
NAKAMA_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.6
NAKAMA_METRICS_ENABLED = true
NAKAMA_METRICS_INTERVAL = 30
```

### NAKAMA_TRACE_ENABLED

Enable tracing with Jaeger. Defaults to `true`.

### NAKAMA_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE

The trace sample rate. Defaults to `0.6`. Only float values between `0` and `1`
are accepted.

### NAKAMA_METRICS_ENABLED

Enable metrics collection with Prometheus. Defaults to `true`.

### NAKAMA_METRICS_INTERVAL

How frequently should the metrics be updated, in seconds. Defaults to every `30`
seconds.
