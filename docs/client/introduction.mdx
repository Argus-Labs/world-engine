# Integrate via Nakama SDK (Recommended)

Cardinal comes out of the box with a Nakama plugin that makes it easy for you to integrate with most modern game engine such as Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc.

Additionally, Cardinal's Nakama plugin utilizes Cardinal's [Persona](/cardinal/game/persona) identity system to provide an account abstraction (AA) feature. By using account abstraction, players can use email/password or social login (Google, Facebook, etc) to play their fully onchain game; therefore, eliminating the crypto/web3 onboarding friction from having to install a wallet or store a private key.

**Features:**

- **Wide range of client libraries and SDKs** -- By using Nakama, you can integrate Cardinal with any of the client libraries and SDKs that Nakama supports. This includes Unity, Unreal, Godot, Javascript, Swift, C++, and more.
- **Account abstraction with email/password & social login** -- Remove onboarding friction of having to download a crypto wallet and manage private keys by allowing your users to login with their email/password or social accounts (Google, Facebook, etc).

# Integrate via REST API

If you need more control over your integration or if you just need a direct way to communicate with Cardinal, you can use Cardinal's REST API.
