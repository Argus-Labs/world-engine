description: A basic example of how to use World Engine
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- World Engine ([quickstart](/quickstart))

## Scaffold a basic example

```bash
world create --example basic
```

The basic example is a close to barebones example of how to use World Engine.

The Cardinal shard contains the following:

- Player **entities**
- Health **component**
- Regen **system**
- Attack **command**
- Player death **event**

While the client is a minimal Go client that operates via command-line.

Once scaffolded, you can run the World Engine stack (Cardinal shard, gateway, etc.) with:

```bash
world dev # TODO
```

Once Tilt is running, you can play around with the client.

```bash
go run cmd/client/main.go create-player johndoe
# go run cmd/client/main.go to see all commands
```
