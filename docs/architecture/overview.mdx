description: Understanding World Engine's architecture and design principles
---

World Engine is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed for high-performance
onchain games. This section provides an overview of the key architectural components and design
principles.

## Core Components

### Cardinal (Game Shard)

Cardinal is the core game server that handles:

- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Efficient game state management
- **Command Processing**: Handling player actions and game logic
- **Query System**: Real-time game state queries
- **Event System**: Game event emission and processing
- **Inter-Shard Communication**: Communication between multiple game instances

### Gateway

Gateway is a service within the World Engine stack that sits in front of your Cardinal shards that handles:

- **Argus ID integration**: Handles Persona signing (in conjunction with Argus ID)
- **One door to your Cardinal shards**: Set the URL in your SDK config, and forget that it even exists

### Client SDKs

Client integration via JavaScript SDK ([@argus-labs/sdk-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@argus-labs/sdk)):

- **JavaScript SDK**: Complete client-side solution with TypeScript support
- **Real-time Events**: Built-in event streaming for reactive gameplay
- **Authentication**: Argus ID integration (Sign in with Argus ID)

TODO: Add C# SDK

### Argus ID

Independent from World Engine, [Argus ID](https://auth.argus.gg) is an auth service that allows you to build
games without worrying about user authentication.

## Design Principles

### 1. **ECS-First Architecture**

Built around Entity Component System patterns for:

- High performance with large numbers of entities
- Flexible game logic composition
- Predictable execution order

### 2. **Command-Query Separation**

Clear separation between:

- **Commands**: Actions that modify game state
- **Queries**: Read-only access to game state
- **Events**: Reactive notifications of state changes

### 3. **Tick-Based Execution**

Deterministic game loop with:

- Fixed tick rate for consistent gameplay
- Batch processing for performance
- Deterministic execution order

### 4. **Inter-Shard Scalability**

Designed for horizontal scaling:

- Multiple game shards for different regions/instances
- Cross-shard communication protocols
