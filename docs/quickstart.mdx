## Install dependencies and World CLI

Learn how to install World Engine dependencies and the World CLI.

<Warning>
    **Note**: This quickstart assumes that you are using MacOS or Linux. If you are using Windows, we recommend you
    use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run World Engine.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="golang" title="Install Go">
        World Engine (WE) is built using [Go](https://golang.org), a performant, easy-to-learn, and expressive
        programming language that is widely used in distributed systems.

        To install Go, follow the instructions on the [Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

        To verify that Go is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        go version
        ```

        **Go beginner tip**: World Engine, combined with the simplicity of Go, makes it easy to get started with
        your game with little to no experience in Go. If this is your first time writing a program in Go,
        we recommend you follow the [Go tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) to familiarize yourself with
        the language. However, you don't need to know any Go to complete this quickstart
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="docker" title="Install Docker">
        World Engine uses [Docker](https://docker.com) to make it easier to develop and deploy your rollup and game in
        any operating system.

        Docker is a containerization tool that allows you to run applications in a sandboxed
        environment; it ensures
        that the World Engine stack will run the same way on your machine as it will on production deployments.

        To install Docker, follow the instructions on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

        To verify that Docker is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        docker version
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Install World CLI ">
        [World CLI](https://github.com/argus-labs/world-cli) is a swiss army knife command-line tool for creating,
        managing, and deploying World Engine projects.

        **Important: World CLI will not work properly without Go and Docker**

        To install World CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        curl https://install.world.dev/cli! | bash
        ```

        **Advanced tip**: If you want to install a specific version of World CLI, you can run the following command:

        ```bash
        curl https://install.world.dev/cli@[release_tag]! | bash
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="planet-ringed" title="Install OrbStack (Optional â€” MacOS only)">
        [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) is a tool that makes it easier to run Docker containers on MacOS. It is not
        required to run World
        Engine, but it is recommended for MacOS users as it provides a better performance and user experience than
        Docker
        Desktop.

        The [Argus Labs](https://argus.gg) team uses OrbStack to develop and build on top of World Engine, and we
        recommend it for MacOS
        users.

        To install OrbStack, follow the instructions on the [OrbStack website](https://orbstack.dev).

## Create your first World Engine project

### Scaffold a boilerplate project

Once you have World CLI installed, you can scaffold your first World Engine game by running the following command in
your terminal:

```bash
world create
```

<img
    className="block"
    src="/images/world-create.png"
    alt="CLI: world create"
/>

<Warning>
    **Troubleshooting**

    If you encountered `Error: dependency check "Docker daemon is running" failed`, make sure that you have
    installed Docker and have Docker Desktop or OrbStack running.
</Warning>


### Start Cardinal in development mode

Once you have scaffolded your project, you can start World Engine's game shard (Cardinal) in development mode by running
the following command from your project directory in your terminal:

```bash
world cardinal dev
```

<Note>
    The development mode is the easiest way to quickly iterate on your game shard code. In contrast to
    `world cardinal start` it skips the Docker image builds process which can take a while.

    Additionally, dev mode provides you with pretty logging that makes it easier to debug your game shard.
    In production, pretty logging is disabled due to its performance drawback at high tickrate configuration where every
    millisecond counts.
</Note>

### Submit a game transaction

Now that you have Cardinal running in development mode, you can submit a game transaction to your game shard.

A Cardinal transaction is a simple REST POST request to Cardinal to perform an action in your game shard. For example, in
the boilerplate project, you can submit a transaction to create a new player in your game.

To submit this transaction, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:3333/tx/game/create-player \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"personaTag": "CoolMage",
	"namespace": "",
	"nonce": 0,
	"signature": "",
	"body": {
		"nickname": "CoolMage"
	}
  }'
```

<Tip>
    **Tip**: You can also use a REST API tool such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) and
    [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to make it easier submit transactions to Cardinal.
</Tip>

<Note>
    Notice that we don't provide a `namespace`, `nonce`, and `signature` for this transaction.

    This is because the boilerplate plate runs with `DisableSignatureVerification()` option declared in `main.go`, which
    means that it will accept any transaction without verifying its signature and relevant fields. In production, you
    should never use this.
</Note>

### Inspect game state using Cardinal Editor

Once you have started your game shard in development mode, you can inspect your game state using Cardinal Editor.

To open Cardinal Editor, navigate to [https://editor.world.dev](https://editor.world.dev) in your browser.

You should now be able to see the player you created in the previous step.
If you submit another transaction, you can see more player entity appear automatically in the Cardinal Editor in real-time.


<img
    className="block"
    src="/images/cardinal-editor.jpg"
    alt="Cardinal Editor"
    style={{borderRadius: '0.5rem'}}
/>

<Check>
    **Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³**

    You have successfully created your first World Engine project, ran a boilerplate Cardinal game shard, and
    submitted your first game transaction. Now you can start exploring the World Engine and build your own game!
