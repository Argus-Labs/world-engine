description: Learn how to integrate Argus Auth into your World Engine game client for seamless user authentication and identity management
---

This guide will walk you through integrating **Argus Auth** into your World Engine game client.
Argus Auth provides secure, seamless authentication that works perfectly with multiplayer games.

<Tip>We use the term Argus Auth and Argus ID interchangeably.</Tip>

## **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have completed the [Quickstart guide](../quickstart).

## Sign in with Argus ID

### Checking authentication state

Use `world.auth.getUser()` to get the current user. If this is your first time using Argus Auth,
this will return `null`. You'd normally do this in the main menu of your game.

```typescript Main Menu
import { world } from './sdk'

export function mainMenu() {
  const user = world.auth.getUser()
  console.log(user)
}
```

The `getUser()` method returns either:

- An `AuthUser` object if the user is authenticated
- `null` if no user is currently signed in

<Accordion title="What's in the AuthUser object?">
The `AuthUser` object contains user information from Argus Auth:

```typescript
interface AuthUser {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  // Additional user properties may be available
}
```

</Accordion>

### Signing in

The following example shows how to sign in if no user is found. This is a simple example,
on your game you might want to show a button to sign in.

```typescript Main Menu highlight={8}
import { world } from './sdk'

export async function mainMenu() {
  let user = world.auth.getUser()

  // Perform sign in if no user is found
  if (!user) {
    const { data, error } = await world.auth.signInWithArgusID()

    if (error) {
      console.error(error)
    } else {
      user = data
    }
  }

  // If there's still no user at this point, something went wrong
  if (!user) {
    alert('Failed to sign in, please try again')
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  The `signInWithArgusID()` method automatically handles the auth flow, including opening the
  authentication popup and managing token. The token is stored in the browser's local storage,
  therefore is persistent across reloads.
</Tip>

## Handling User Logout

Use the `logout()` method to sign out the current user:

```typescript Logout
import { world } from './sdk'

export function handleLogout() {
  world.auth.logout()
  console.log('User has been logged out')
}
```
