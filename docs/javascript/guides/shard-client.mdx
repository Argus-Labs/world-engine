description: Learn how to use the Shard Client to interact with your World Engine shard
---

If you've gone through the [quickstart guide](../quickstart), you've already created a shard client and
used it to send commands and queries to your shard.

If you missed it, a shard client connects to a specific Cardinal shard.
It lets you send commands, query game state, and listen for events from that shard.

## Registering a shard client

You do this by calling `world.shard.register`:

```typescript Register Shard Client
import { world } from './sdk'

const shard = world.shard.register({
  organization: 'argus', // corresponds to CARDINAL_ORG
  project: 'demo', // corresponds to CARDINAL_PROJECT
  shardId: 'cardinal-demo-game-1', // corresponds to CARDINAL_SHARD_ID
})

// You can create shard clients for different shards
```
